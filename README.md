# SpotifyWebTool

The idea behind this webtool is to enable the user more freedom when searching and creating their playlists.
The app will present the user with a list of their recently played songs and give them the option to like the song they want to hear more from.
Then using the songs genre or artist name, create a playlist of potential songs you would like to listen to and add them to your spotify account as a spotify plylist.

The project remains currently unfinished due to Spotify removing their API token from free use and requesting that developer accounts be created.

Fetures currently available:
	- List of recently played songs presented
  - CRUD options available for the list as well
  - Like button present that automatically likes the song on Spotify as well
  - Search bar that searches for all the songs and artisti with the name entered.
